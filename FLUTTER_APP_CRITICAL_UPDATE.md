# 🚨 CRITICAL UPDATE REQUIRED - Flutter App Amount

## ❌ **Current Problem:**
Your Flutter app is still sending ₹0.2 instead of ₹5, causing:
- Payment failures
- Automatic refunds
- No emails sent
- Status button not updating

## 🔧 **What You MUST Change:**

### **1. Update Payment Amount (CRITICAL)**
Find this in your Flutter app and change it:

```dart
// OLD CODE (causing failures)
final amount = 0.1;  // or 0.2
final amount = 0.2;  // or any value below ₹5

// NEW CODE (will work)
final amount = 5.0;  // ₹5.00 application fee
```

### **2. Update UI Text**
Change any text that shows the old amount:

```dart
// OLD TEXT
Text('Application Fee: ₹0.1')
Text('Application Fee: ₹0.2')
Text('Fee: ₹0.1')

// NEW TEXT
Text('Application Fee: ₹5.00')
Text('Application Fee: ₹5.00')
Text('Fee: ₹5.00')
```

### **3. Update Payment Request Data**
Make sure your payment request sends ₹5:

```dart
final paymentData = {
  'application_id': jobId,
  'payment_id': paymentId,
  'amount': 5.0,  // CHANGE THIS TO 5.0
  'razorpay_payment_id': razorpayPaymentId,
  'razorpay_order_id': razorpayOrderId,
  'razorpay_signature': razorpaySignature,
  'payment_method': 'razorpay',
  'user_email': userEmail,
  'gateway_response': gatewayResponse
};
```

## 📱 **Where to Look in Your Flutter App:**

1. **Payment Screen** - Look for amount variable
2. **Job Application Screen** - Check fee display
3. **Payment Processing** - Verify amount being sent
4. **API Calls** - Ensure ₹5 is in the request

## 🎯 **Why ₹5 is Required:**

- **₹0.1/₹0.2:** Too low, triggers automatic refunds
- **₹1-₹4:** Below minimum threshold
- **₹5:** Perfect amount, no refunds, works correctly

## 🧪 **Test After Update:**

1. **Update amount to ₹5** in Flutter app
2. **Complete a payment**
3. **Check if email is received**
4. **Verify status button updates to "Accepted"**
5. **Check Razorpay dashboard** - should show ₹5 successful

## 🚨 **If You Don't Update:**

- ❌ Payments will continue to fail
- ❌ Money will keep getting deducted and refunded
- ❌ No emails will be sent
- ❌ Status buttons won't update
- ❌ Users will be frustrated

## ✅ **After Update:**

- ✅ ₹5 payment will be successful
- ✅ No automatic refunds
- ✅ Email will be sent immediately
- ✅ Status button will show "Accepted"
- ✅ Complete flow will work perfectly

## 🔍 **Search in Your Flutter Code:**

Search for these terms in your Flutter app:
- `amount = 0.1`
- `amount = 0.2`
- `amount: 0.1`
- `amount: 0.2`
- `₹0.1`
- `₹0.2`

**Replace ALL instances with ₹5.00**
