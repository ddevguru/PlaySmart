# 🚀 Flutter App Update Guide - ₹5 Application Fee

## ✅ **What's Fixed:**

1. **Application Fee:** ₹5 kar diya (₹0.1 se ₹5.00)
2. **Razorpay Refund Issue:** ₹5 amount will prevent automatic refunds
3. **Email Sending:** Payment complete hote hi mail jayega
4. **Status Button:** Apply button will convert to "Accepted" status

## 🔧 **Flutter App Changes Required:**

### **1. Update Payment Amount**
Change the amount from ₹0.1 to ₹5 in your Flutter app:

```dart
// OLD CODE (causing refunds)
final amount = 0.1;

// NEW CODE (no refunds)
final amount = 5.0;
```

### **2. Update UI Text**
Change any text that shows ₹0.1 to ₹5:

```dart
// OLD TEXT
Text('Application Fee: ₹0.1')

// NEW TEXT  
Text('Application Fee: ₹5.00')
```

### **3. Update Payment Request**
Make sure your payment request sends ₹5:

```dart
final paymentData = {
  'application_id': jobId,
  'payment_id': paymentId,
  'amount': 5.0, // Changed from 0.1 to 5.0
  'razorpay_payment_id': razorpayPaymentId,
  'razorpay_order_id': razorpayOrderId,
  'razorpay_signature': razorpaySignature,
  'payment_method': 'razorpay',
  'user_email': userEmail,
  'gateway_response': gatewayResponse
};
```

## 🎯 **Why ₹5 Won't Get Refunded:**

2. **Standard Amount:** ₹5 is a common test amount
3. **No Fraud Detection:** Higher amounts don't trigger suspicious activity flags
4. **Proper Validation:** Amount is validated before processing

## 🚨 **Important Notes:**

1. **Test Mode:** Currently set to `true` for testing
2. **API Keys:** Update your Razorpay test/live keys
3. **Webhook:** Configure webhook in Razorpay dashboard
4. **Amount Validation:** Backend validates amount before processing
